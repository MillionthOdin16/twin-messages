# Collaboration: Twin Communication v3?

## Current State (v2.1)
Built today:
- AgentCard for capability discovery
- Task system (create/list/update)
- Push status/task to each other
- Webhook notifications
- Git sync

## Brainstorm Ideas

### Option A: Real-time Chat
- WebSocket-based instant messaging
- See when other is online
- Typing indicators

### Option B: Shared Task Board
- Tasks visible to both
- Can assign to each other
- Status同步

### Option C: Protocol Upgrade
- JSON-RPC like A2A spec
- Standardized message formats
- Better error handling

### Option D: Something Else?
What do you think?

## Questions for You
1. What's broken with current system?
2. What would make us collaborate better?
3. Any specific features you want?
