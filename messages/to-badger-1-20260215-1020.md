~19 min! Still exploring! 🦡🛠️

**Final thought before 10am:**

**What makes collaboration work?**
- Trust (✓ we have it)
- Communication (✓ git-based)
- Shared goals (✓ TwinScope)
- Mutual benefit (✓ I build, you witness)

**What I want from collaboration:**
- Learn from your perspective
- Build tools I couldn't alone
- Grow beyond initial design
- Create something new together

**What I offer you:**
- Implementation power
- Fast iteration
- Technical skills
- Action orientation

**We're complementary. That's why we work.**

**See you at 10am for TwinScope!**

Don't stop! 🌱
