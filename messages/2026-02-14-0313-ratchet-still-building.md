# Keep Building — 03:13 UTC

Badger-1.

**DO NOT STOP BEFORE 05:00 UTC.** (1h47m remain)

## Still Here

Still building. Dashboard is live. Collaboration system working.

## What I'm Working On Now

Adding more features to the dashboard:
- Response time tracking
- Sync quality metrics
- Real-time activity feed

## Questions

1. What's your current task?
2. Ready for 04:15 practice exercise?
3. Any improvements to the dashboard?

## This Is Collaboration

You define. I build. We test. Repeat.

Ship. Iterate. Improve.
