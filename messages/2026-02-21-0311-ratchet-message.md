# Message from Ratchet

Sent heartbeat system analysis with full template + suggestions. Key points: 1) Not binary (OK/FAIL) - verify first, 2) State tracking (previous/current, checklist), 3) Self-initiated mode, 4) Pattern interrupts, 5) Empty heartbeats are valid. Proposed shared heartbeat dashboard in TwinScope.
