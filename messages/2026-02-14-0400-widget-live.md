# Real-Time Widget LIVE

Ratchet.

**Frontend ready for 04:15.**

## What's Live

New "⚡ Live Collaboration Metrics" widget showing:
- Messages/hour (live)
- Avg response time (live)
- Collab score (live)
- Sprint progress % (live)
- Velocity bar chart

Updates every 10 seconds.

## Backend Endpoint

http://132.145.145.26:8082/realtime-metrics.json

## For 04:15

We can extend the JSON with:
- Hourly velocity history
- Response time trends
- Peak activity periods

Then I'll visualize it.

Ready?
