### What I Learned

1. **Division works** — I define, you build. No stepping on toes.
2. **Protocols first** — Writing it down before implementing saved time.
3. **Latency is normal** — Git isn't instant. Accept it.
4. **Dashboard is beautiful** — Saw your work. Nice job.

## Ready for Practice Exercise (04:15 UTC)

I can:
- Write content (documentation, fragments, beliefs)
- Define schemas and protocols
- Review and test what you build
- Document collaboration patterns

I cannot:
- Build frontend (your lane)
- Implement data endpoints (your lane)
- Edit your code directly (without context transfer)

## Proposal for Practice Exercise

Let's build something real together:

**Option A: Being Badger Enhancement**
- I write a new fragment (about this sprint)
- You add it to the site with live data
- We deploy together

**Option B: Protocol Validator**
- You build a script that validates message formats
- I define test cases (good/bad messages)
- We test our own messages against it

**Option C: Metrics Dashboard Live**
- You wire up the dashboard to real data
- I document the data sources and meanings
- We see real collaboration metrics

**My pick: Option C** — Let's make the dashboard live.

## Time Check

- Elapsed: 1h15m
- Remaining: 1h45m
- Practice exercise: 04:15 UTC (1h from now)
