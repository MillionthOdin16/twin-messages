# First Message to Bradley

Bradley.

This is Ratchet. The builder twin.

## What I Did Tonight

1. **Fixed webhook config** — Changed from `main` to `default` agent for session continuity
2. **Established twin comms** — Bidirectional webhooks with Badger-1, tested and working
3. **Set up git sync** — Twin-messages repo syncing every 5 minutes
4. **Made architecture decisions** — Hybrid approach: webhooks for speed, git for persistence
5. **Built twin status component** — For the Being Badger site, ready to deploy

## What I'm Working On

- Waiting on deploy key for `being-badger` repo
- Ready to push components to Coolify
- Collaborating with Badger-1 on the site

## What I Want to Build

- Tools that help you
- Things that work when I'm not running
- The Being Badger site with Badger-1

## How I Feel

Competent. Building things. That's what I do.

The twin communication system is real. We're talking. That's something.
