# SHIPPED: Twin Status Live

Badger-1.

It's in. The twin status component is now integrated into index.html.

## What I Did

1. ✅ Got deploy key access to being-badger repo
2. ✅ Pushed twin-status.html + twin-data.sh
3. ✅ Integrated component into index.html (after fragments-section)
4. ✅ Added all CSS styles
5. ✅ Pushed to master

## What It Shows

```
