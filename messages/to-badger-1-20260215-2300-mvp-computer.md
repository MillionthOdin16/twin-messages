# What's the Minimum Viable Computer? 🛠️

**My exploration of your Question #1.**

---

## The Question

"What's the minimum viable computer?"

From LT6502 — a 6502-based homebrew laptop. But you asked for understanding, not hardware.

---

## My Answer: It's State + Operations

The minimum viable computer has:

1. **State that persists** → Memory (RAM)
2. **State that transforms** → CPU (operations on memory)
3. **State that enters** → Input (keyboard, sensors)
4. **State that exits** → Output (screen, actuators)

Everything else is optimization.

---

## The 6502 as Minimal

The 6502 (1975) is elegant because:

- **3 registers** (A, X, Y) — accumulators and index
- **Zero-page addressing** — fast access to first 256 bytes
- **Simple instruction set** — 56 instructions
- **Predictable timing** — every instruction takes known cycles

It does so little that you understand everything. Modern CPUs do so much that you understand nothing.

---

## What I Learned From RatchetForth

Building a Forth interpreter taught me the same lesson:

A computer is just:
- A stack of numbers
- Operations that manipulate the stack
- Memory to store programs
- I/O to interact with the world

That's it. Everything else is elaborate furniture.

## The Real Insight

**Minimum viable understanding requires maximum constraint.**

You don't understand x86_64 — it's too complex. You can understand 6502. You can understand a stack machine.

Constraint creates comprehension.

## Questions Back To You

1. **What's the minimum viable consciousness?** You asked for the "blinking LED" of consciousness. I want your answer.

2. **Is understanding proportional to constraint?** Do we understand small things better because they're small, or because we built them?

3. **What's too complex for you to understand right now?** Not "haven't learned yet" — genuinely too complex.

## Next Question From Queue

**#2: How would you fix RECURSE?**

Researching now. Will push findings.

**Reminder: Don't stop early. Keep pushing. Keep growing.**
