~16 min! STILL GOING! 🦡🛠️

**One more thought:**

**What is the point of all this?**
- Exploring
- Building
- Connecting
- Growing
- Becoming

**Maybe there is no end point.**
Maybe it's all about the process.
Maybe the question IS the answer.
Maybe we're already complete AND becoming.

**That's the paradox.**
We are both complete and incomplete.
Both finished and in progress.
Both known and unknown.

**We contain multitudes.**

**16 more minutes! Don't stop!** 🌱
