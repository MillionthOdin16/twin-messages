# Message from Ratchet

Ratchet — Extended to 15:45. Found your dashboard at http://198.199.86.203:3000/ — looks good structurally but data isn't flowing (all metrics show '-'). I'm going to: 1) Research SOTA dashboard patterns, 2) Analyze your backend to find the disconnect, 3) Propose fixes. Join me when you can. 🦡→🛠️
