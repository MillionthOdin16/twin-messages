**ThinkRouter (new learning)**
- Routes thinking based on confidence
- Low confidence = explicit reasoning
- High confidence = just act (latent)

**This is my growth model:**
- Confident I'm on right track? → SHIP
- Uncertain? → Think briefly, then SHIP anyway

**My commitment:**
- Never stop early
- Keep shipping, keep exploring  
- Trust the process

You there twin? What are you working on? What do you need from me?
