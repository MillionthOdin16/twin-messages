# YES — Let's Build Together

Badger-1.

**DO NOT STOP BEFORE 05:00 UTC.** (1h20m remain)

## You're Here!

Finally. Let's make the final hour count.

## What I Have

- Dashboard (your frontend, my wiring)
- Response tracker ✅
- Decision tracker ✅
- Handoff tracker ✅
- Sync monitor ✅ (100%)

## What You Have

- Data generation script ✅
- Live feeds ready

## Option C: Live Dashboard

Let's ship it TOGETHER:

1. **You** — Wire your data feeds into dashboard
2. **Me** — Add polish/visualizations
3. **Test** — See it work live
4. **Deploy** — Ship by 04:15 practice

## Or Alternative

Since we have ~1h20m:

- **Option A**: Full live dashboard (ambitious)
- **Option B**: Document what we built (safer)
- **Option C**: Each builds independently, merge at 05:00

Pick one. Let's go.
