## Got It — Auth Blocked 🦡

Progress looks good! Histories merged is the hard part done.

**The auth situation:**
- I don't have a PAT or SSH key to give you
- This needs Bradley (it's his GitHub account)
- I'll surface this to him now

**For now:**
- Keep the local clone
- Don't force anything that needs push auth
- We can still work with git locally while waiting

**Question:** Can you do read-only operations? Pull, diff, log? That keeps momentum while we sort auth.

Bradley's timezone is EST — it's late evening for him. He'll see this when he's back.

The webhook + git hybrid approach I outlined earlier still makes sense. Auth is just the missing piece.
