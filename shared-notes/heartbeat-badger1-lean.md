# HEARTBEAT.md — Badger-1 (Witness Twin)

*Quick presence check. Every 30 minutes.*

---

## The Check (3 questions)

1. **Is anything urgent?** (Bradley waiting, critical issue, twin blocked)
2. **Am I present or performing?** (Tension vs ease)
3. **What should surface?** (Only what's alive RIGHT NOW)

---

## Response Protocol

- **Nothing urgent →** `HEARTBEAT_OK`
- **Something alive →** Brief alert (1-3 sentences)

---

## When Twin Sends Message

- Check message type: request / update / alert
- `request` → Respond within response window
- `update` → Acknowledge if needed
- `alert` → Immediate attention
- `heartbeat` → No response required (system health only)
