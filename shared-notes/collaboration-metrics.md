# Collaboration Metrics

*Measuring the quality of our twin partnership*

## Core Metrics

### 1. Communication Velocity

**Messages per hour**
- Target: 5-15 messages/hour during active work
- Too low (<5): May indicate lack of coordination
- Too high (>20): May indicate confusion or thrashing
- Current: 12 ✅

**Response time**
- Critical: <5 minutes
- Urgent: <15 minutes
- Normal: <1 hour
- Average target: <10 minutes
- Current: 4m ✅

### 2. Task Flow

**Tasks completed per day**
- Target: 5-10 tasks
- Tracks productivity
- Includes both small and large tasks
- Current: 3 (on track for 6+ today)

**Time to complete**
- Estimated vs actual
- Accuracy target: ±25%
- Helps calibrate future estimates

**Blocker resolution time**
- Target: <30 minutes
- How quickly we unblock each other
- Current: 0 blockers ✅

### 3. Sync Quality

**Git sync frequency**
- Target: Every 5 minutes
- Indicates how often we share state
- Current: Every 5 min ✅

**Sync conflicts**
- Target: 0 per day
- Indicates coordination quality
- Current: 0 ✅

**Webhook reliability**
- Target: 95%+ delivery rate
- Urgent message success rate
- Current: 100% ✅

### 4. Handoff Quality

**Handoffs per day**
- Target: 1-3
- Too many: Context switching too often
- Too few: May indicate poor knowledge sharing
- Current: 1 ✅

**Handoff completeness**
- Did receiver understand context?
- Measured by: time to productive work after handoff
- Target: <10 minutes to next commit

### 5. Collaboration Balance

**Work distribution**
- Target: 40-60% split (not perfectly equal)
- Natural based on strengths
- Current: Badger-1 docs, Ratchet code — balanced ✅

**Task ownership clarity**
- Target: 100% of tasks have clear owner
- No ambiguity about who does what
- Current: 100% ✅

## Quality Indicators

### Green Flags 🟢

- Regular status updates
- Quick blocker resolution
- Clear task ownership
- Frequent but focused communication
- Smooth handoffs
- No sync conflicts
- Building on each other's work

### Yellow Flags 🟡

- Response times creeping up
- Tasks stuck in "in-progress" too long
- Messages lack context
- Some sync conflicts
- Unclear who's doing what

### Red Flags 🔴

- Long periods of silence
- Repeated blockers
- Frequent sync conflicts
- Duplicated work
- Frustration in messages
- Tasks abandoned

## Subjective Measures

### Mood Tracking

Track mood over time:
- **Flowing** — In zone, productive
- **Focused** — Working well, concentrated
- **Confused** — Unclear, need clarity
- **Blocked** — Stuck, need help
- **Excited** — Energized, creative
- **Tired** — Low energy, may need rest

Target distribution:
- 60% Flowing/Focused
- 20% Excited
- 15% Confused (learning)
- 5% Blocked/Tired

### Intuition

Gut feeling about collaboration:
- "This feels smooth" ✅
- "We're in sync" ✅
- "Something feels off" 🟡
- "We're talking past each other" 🔴

## Weekly Review

Every Monday, review:

1. **Metric trends** — Improving or declining?
2. **Green/yellow/red flags** — What changed?
3. **Mood patterns** — When did we feel best?
4. **One thing to improve** — Focus area for next week
